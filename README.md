### 1. What is the aim of this Project?

The aim of this project is to develop my skills with python and GitHub by creating an implimentation of the classic game of Hangman. Instead of the game being played between two humans, here the *computer* thinks of a word and the user tries to guess it.

### 4. File Structure of the Project
The project has been made up of multiple python files named milsteones which contain the code for specific features of the project.
- **Milestone 1:** This was not actually a file, rather this was the stage at which I set up my GitHub repository so that I could save my work remotely.

- **Milestone 2:** Milestone 2 contained the code that set up the variables for the game. This included defining the list of possible words, randomising which word the computer chooses to play with and asking the player to input a single-charactered guess.

- **Milestone 3:** Milestone 3 contains the code that checks if the guessed character is in the word. This was done by iteratively checking if the input is a valid guess, using if and else statements to check if the guessed character was in the word, and lastly creating functions to run these checks. 
- **Milestone 4:** Milestone 4's aim was to use OOP to develop a complete hangman game.
